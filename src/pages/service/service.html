        The following courses are usually meant to be further tailored individually to your scenario. We create a
        fitting concept in a (free) call and
        align on all the details. With that I can create your individual quote. â˜º

        All courses can be held online or in person. All of them are either available in German or English.

      <p class="card-subtitle">Two days full of communication, positivity, and interactive learning.</p>
      <p class="card-content">
        Peer reviews are more than Merge Requests. And they are a constant source of discussion, misundarstandings, and
        bottlenecks. Let's fix that! âšŸ
      </p>
      <p class="card-content">
        In this course, that is usually set for two days, we discuss a lot of communication. How to interact with each
        other, get the message across, and how to translate that into peer reviews for software engineering teams. We
        redefine what that means beyond "Pull Requests" and learn practical tools to actually put everything into
        practice. <br />
        For a shorter cycle time, higher velocity, and most importantly, more positivity. ðŸŽ”

      <p class="card-content">
        Having a crisp internal communication concept sets you up for success. You will forcefully find out whether you
        have one if you go distributed. If that doesn't work out well, I'm here for you!
      </p>
      <p class="card-content">
        In this one-day training, we discuss how to work distributed. That means, not being co-located in a single
        room. It's a workshop where we try to find out, what your concept lacks and how we can fix these gaps. Fear
        not, I got you! âš­

        There is also the option where I stay with you! If you have very specific problems, that we may not be able to
        solve on a call, in a workshop, or via chat, I can offer to observe your team. A neutral, objective perspective
        is often the sole thing needed to find the root cause of any issue within a team.
        Do not hesitate to contact me! It's going to be a lot of fun, promise.
